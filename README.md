# PWall

Hey there, I'm PWall, I use She/They pronouns! I have coding experience in Python, C, TypeScript and JavaScript.
I am rocking a Debian 11 system, and I manage two Debian servers, one general purpose and other as a DNS and DHCP server. I have some experience on home grade networking and Windows.

## Current Situation

I finished my TypeScript project long ago that is available at [OmClient](https://github.com/pwall2222/OmClient), I started working on a lot of stuff like my whole Valorant Python Api project over at [ValUtils](https://github.com/ValUtils) and I also have my contributions to opensource projects in [FlowerAce](https://github.com/FlowerAce).
