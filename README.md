# PWall

Hey there, I'm Sunny, I use She/They pronouns! I have coding experience in Rust, Python, JavaScript (TS) and PHP.
I am rocking a Debian Sid & Windows 10 main machine (damn you Windows 11, danm you), I like messing with all kinds of stuff so I have setup multiple machines to act as VPN, proxy, hosting of my applications.
Being very broad reaching means I can do anything interesting thrown at me (do not try to nerd snipe me I will die).

## Current Situation

I am currently doing stuff with my life but appart of that I am kinda mantaining a game (Valorant) "snooper" [NOWT](https://github.com/pwall2222/NOWT), and working on my python libraries for said game [ValUtils](https://github.com/ValUtils).
Most of my contributions to other projects are over at [FlowerAce](https://github.com/FlowerAce).
If you want to look at my older stuff, you will find a lot of bad desitions messy code and an undying passion for learning, so let me know if you venture in.
