# PWall

Hey there, I'm PWall, I use She/They pronouns! I have coding experience on Python, C, TypeScript and JavaScript.
I am rocking a Debian 11 system, and I manage two Debian servers, one general porpouse and other as a DNS and DHCP server. I have some experience on home grade networking and Windows.

## Current Situation

I am finishing my big TypeScript project, that is a randomized videochat.
